	Schema
		// TO INVESTIGATE
		Do we need this? Add parent references so you can walk up chain starting from anywhere

		Add full validation of 
			schema
			directives
				// DefaultValue definition matches the type
				// Usage value matched the definintion type


		Output as text the schema (optional output of built-in directives and scalars)
		Location populated in all exceptions
		Allow extend syntax nodes
		Apply extend changes and validate

	Request
		allow variables in operation
		allow variables as input values instead of a constant
		why is 'field4?' allowed in the reference implementation?


	Request processing
		return node that has data and exceptions
		validate incoming request against schema
			validate document
			validate variables

		@skip
		@include
